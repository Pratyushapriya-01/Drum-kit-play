# Drum-kit-play

Made Drum kit play project using html , css and javascript during my journey of completing the course of full stack web development using MERN . 
It's really fun to make this project also implimenting & understanding the concept of DOM (Document Object Model) .
Using This proj one can play the drumstick on the desktop .
